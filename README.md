# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help the School Board identify a piece of evidence that the results for the Math and Reading tests were manipulated, specifically the ones for ninth graders at Thomas High School. To accomplish this, Thomas High School's data was removed (by replacing it with NaNs) to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
-	How is the district summary affected?

Overall, the district summary analysis shows that removing the data for just 461 students of Thomas High School from ninth grade for Math and Reading will not significantly impact the results. The % of passing in math and reading reduced by 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. 

(See comparison on Figure 1 “District Summary Analysis before and after replacing with NaNs”)
